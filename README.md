# Europay

Europay is an open-source payment system inspired by Visa/Mastercard, written in Rust. It provides a framework for processing electronic transactions securely and efficiently.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create and manage user accounts with balances.
- **Payment Cards**: Issue and manage payment cards with expiration and status tracking.
- **Transaction Processing**: Handle authorization, capture, and settlement of transactions.
- **Security**: Basic encryption, tokenization, and fraud detection.
- **ISO 8583 Messaging**: Support for financial transaction messages (basic implementation).
- **Merchant Support**: Onboard merchants and process their transactions.

## Architecture

The system is built with modularity in mind:

- `accounts`: Account management
- `cards`: Payment card handling
- `transactions`: Transaction processing logic
- `messaging`: ISO 8583 message handling
- `merchants`: Merchant management
- `security`: Security features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
